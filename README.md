# Algorithm-Design-and-Analysis

The repository contains completed laboratory works on the course "Analysis and development of algorithms", ITMO University.

Task 4 considers the algorithms for unconstrained nonlinear optimization and Stochastic and metaheuristic algorithms.

Task 6 considers the simplest algorithms for finding shortest paths on weighted graphs (including grid graphs).

In task 8, the Johnson's and Kruskal's algorithms for graphs are studied in detail. Both algorithms are implemented and studied in terms of time and space complexity.
